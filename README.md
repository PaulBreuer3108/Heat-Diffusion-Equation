# Heat Diffusion Equation

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation of the **Heat Diffusion Equation**. 
The simulation solves the heat equation numerically and demonstrates the temporal evolution of the heat distribution in a given domain.

## Features
- Numerical solution using finite-difference methods.
- Visualization of the heat distribution over time.
- Fully documented and easy to reproduce.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the dependencies.

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/Heat-Diffusion.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Heat-Diffusion
   ```
3. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Run the Notebook
